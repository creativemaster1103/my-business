# Hoolest — business automations

## Competitor Ad Swipe

Automates: **find competitor ads running 30+ days → extract the script → rewrite for
VeRelief Prime → file it in Notion.**

### Why longevity

A DTC brand does not keep paying to run a creative for 30 days unless it is profitable. Ad
longevity is the only free performance signal available on a competitor, so "still running
after 30 days" is the filter that separates validated concepts from everything they tested and
killed. The pipeline mines that signal and nothing else.

### How it runs

The whole chain runs through MCP connectors, so it lives as a **Claude Code skill** rather than
a script on a cron box. There is no scraping and no stored competitor login.

```
TrendTrack MCP        →  competitor ads + days-running
      ↓  filter ≥ 30 days, drop already-swiped
Higgsfield MCP        →  transcribe the ad video when no text script exists
      ↓
brook-adblock-analyzer →  Hook/Body/CTA blocks + primary angle
      ↓
VeRelief Prime brief  →  rewrite structure, replace every word + claim, compliance gate
      ↓
Notion MCP            →  Video Brief page + Ad Creative Pipeline row, related
```

### Run it

```
/competitor-ad-swipe
```

Or scope it: `/competitor-ad-swipe Pulsetto only, last 60 days`.

### Required connectors

Enable all four in the chat's connector settings before the first run:

- **Trend Track MCP** — discovery
- **Notion** — destination
- **Higgsfield** — video transcription
- **Shopify** — live price/offer

Direct HTTPS to `trendtrack.io` is blocked by the sandbox egress proxy. That is expected: the
MCP connector reaches TrendTrack over a different path. Do not work around it by scraping.

### Files

| Path | What |
|---|---|
| `.claude/skills/competitor-ad-swipe/SKILL.md` | The pipeline |
| `.claude/skills/competitor-ad-swipe/references/verelief-prime-brief.md` | Voice, avatars, approved claims, compliance gate |
| `.claude/skills/competitor-ad-swipe/references/notion-map.md` | Notion IDs + property mapping |
| `config/competitors.yml` | Watchlist, thresholds, excluded angles |

### Schedule

A Routine fires a fresh session every **Monday 00:00 Philippine time** and runs the sweep end
to end. Trigger id `trig_01Awavxwivudwt9MurxicY7y`. Push and email notifications on.

The cron is `0 16 * * 0` — **Sunday** 16:00 UTC. Philippine time is UTC+8 with no daylight
saving, so midnight Monday local falls on Sunday afternoon UTC and the day-of-week shifts back
a day. Editing the hour without also moving the day would silently schedule it a day late.

Watchlist confirmed 2026-08-29 (all six competitors).

**Still open:** the regulatory posture of VeRelief Prime. The claim set in the brand brief is
written conservatively on purpose; whether the device is positioned as a general wellness
device or carries an FDA clearance (and for what indication) decides how far those claims can
stretch. Until that is confirmed, the conservative set stands.

### What it deliberately does not do

- Never edits or deletes an existing Notion row — it only creates.
- Never reuses a competitor's words, claims, or proof; only their structure and angle.
- Never files a script that fails the compliance gate.
- Never exceeds `max_new_briefs_per_run`.
